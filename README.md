## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m a Computer Engineering student at Politecnico di Milano with a deep passion for Linux and hands-on homelab experimentation. I enjoy designing and managing my own self-hosted environments to dive into networking, server administration, and virtualization. Fascinated by cybersecurity, I’m dedicated to mastering threat analysis and system hardening with the goal of building secure infrastructures and protecting critical data. Always curious, I embrace every opportunity to learn, innovate, and connect with fellow tech enthusiasts.
